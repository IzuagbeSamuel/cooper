            <p>
              jQuery is a popular library for writing Javascript. It makes it much more faster and easier to use Javascript on your website. jQuery
              takes a lot of commands in a few lines of codes compared to many lines of codes while writing Javascript and wrap them into methods you
              can call with a single line of code.
            </p>
            <p>
              It is a cross-browser Javascript library that is mainly used to simplify HTML scripting. jQuery makes use of powerful, clean, and simple
              syntax that makes it easier to pick the DOM elements on the webpage. I advice you to know more about Javascript before going into
              jQuery.
